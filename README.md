# Project and Portfolio VI

## Portfolio Plan

As a web designer and developer, I figured my Portfolio should be a showcase of my skills in and of itself (Jones). As a result, I am going to make a single page React.JS web application hosted via GitHub pages. This is also a good way to stay in practice, and it affords me total control over my website (Brabender). I will also make use of React-Bootstrap for professional styling.

I plan on including:
1.	[The Atlanta Federal Reserveâ€™s Career Ladder Identifier and Financial Forecaster](https://emar-data-tools.shinyapps.io/cliff_dashboard_demo/)
2.	[My WayGo app](https://waygo-production.herokuapp.com/)
3.	[My Server-Side-Languages \(WDD353\) app](https://github.com/ColemanMatthew-FS/WDD_353_FRONTEND_TO_BACKEND)
4.	[My Project and Portfolio 4 app](https://colemanmatthew-fs.github.io/Project-and-Portfolio-4/)
5.	[My Programming for Web Applications app](https://github.com/ColemanMatthew-FS/Coleman_Matthew_PRW/tree/04_API)

The goal is to create a professional feel, similar to portfolios made in dedicated apps such as those provided by Adobe. It will be a single page application, to reduce complexity, featuring Bootstrap design standards. Furthermore, some of the repositories listed above may need to be modified for readability and accessibility. The WayGo app in particular will likely need its backend to be moved to a different host.
