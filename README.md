# Matthew's Portfolio


As a web designer and developer, I figured my Portfolio should be a showcase of my skills in and of itself. My original portfolio was made back in 2022 using React Bootstrap, and I decided I should show of how far I've come, both as a designer and as a developer, using Next.JS and Tailwind.
