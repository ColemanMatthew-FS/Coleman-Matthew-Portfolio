# Matthew's Portfolio


As a web designer and developer, I figured my Portfolio should be a showcase of my skills in and of itself. My original portfolio was made back in 2022 using React Bootstrap, and I decided I should show of how far I've come, both as a designer and as a developer, using Next.JS and Tailwind. The original website was deployed via the [gh-pages dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) and with GitHub Pages set to deploy from a branch in the GitHub settings, now I'm using [this tutorial.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-next-js-app-to-github-pages/)
